This lab focuses on creating advanced visualizations using the Seaborn library in Python. Students learn to explore datasets, visualize distributions, relationships, and comparisons, and interpret correlations. Exercises include histograms with KDE, scatter plots with hue and style, box plots grouped by categories, and correlation heatmaps. The lab emphasizes using Seaborn’s features to produce informative and visually appealing plots for data analysis.
